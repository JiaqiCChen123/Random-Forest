# Random-Forest
Random Forest Implementation (Comparable to sklearn)

## Goal
Here I build a random forest model (regressor and classifier); The model's accuracy is comparable to sklearn, sometimes even a slight better than that. 

The random forest model contains basic features (like n_estimators, min_samples_leaf, max_features, bootstrap, OOB_score, etc.)

There are two python files:
* tree.py 
This file contains basic fuctions to build decision trees and simple random forest functions.
* rf.py 
This file specifies random forest regressor and random forest classifier's detailed functions.
